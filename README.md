# Sudoku Solver App

## Overview
The Sudoku Solver  is a project that makes use of Computer Vision to solve a sudoku puzzle. It takes an image of the sudoku puzzle as the input and generates the solved sudoku as the output.

## Frameworks used
This project is mainly written in Python and uses frameworks like PyTorch and OpenCV for training of the model and image preprocessing.

## Parts of the Project
1.[Image preprocessing for the input sudoku](#link1);
2.[Training the model for digit recognition](#link2);
3.[Solving the Sudoku](#link3);
4.[ Displaying the solution](#link4);

It is a firm conviction with the adepts that it is better to have two or three in a community who are earnestly and indefatigably striving to conquer their lower selves and unite with their higher selves than to have two or three thousand public followers who are largely nominal only. They are interested in, and appreciative of, quality rather than quantity. Nor do they consider it sensible to propagate their wisdom among men whose minds are too undeveloped, whose intuition is too uncultivated, and whose hearts are too unprepared to receive it readily and sympathetically.It is a firm conviction with the adepts that it is better to have two or three in a community who are earnestly and indefatigably striving to conquer their lower selves and unite with their higher selves than to have two or three thousand public followers who are largely nominal only.
