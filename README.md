# Sudoku Solver App

## Overview
The Sudoku Solver  is a project that makes use of Computer Vision to solve a sudoku puzzle. It takes an image of the sudoku puzzle as the input and generates the solved sudoku as the output.

## Frameworks used
This project is mainly written in Python and uses frameworks like PyTorch and OpenCV for training of the model and image preprocessing.

## Parts of the Project
1.[Image preprocessing for the input sudoku](#https://github.com/shreyas1209/Sudoku_Solver_App/blob/main/README.md#image-preprocessing-for-the-input-sudoku);
2.[Training the model for digit recognition](#link2);
3.[Solving the Sudoku](#link3);
4.[ Displaying the solution](#link4);
